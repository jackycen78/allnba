# All NBA Team Modelling

This project looks at the statistics of NBA players for the past ~30 years, and attempts to predict the factors that most influence an all NBA team selection. The data is obtained from basketball-reference.com, using the BeautifulSoup api to parse through the necessary data. In terms of the models, I have used multi-variate logistic regression and random forests, both using sklearn implementation.
